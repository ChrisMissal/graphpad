# GraphPad samples

## Sample datasets

- **Animal Taxonomy**: A hierarchy that demonstrates `is-a` relationships and transitive edges.
- **Family Tree**: Parent/child relationships that are easy to extend with new nodes.
- **Organization**: Manager relationships plus a `works-with` edge to illustrate non-hierarchical links.
- **Empty Graph**: Start from scratch to build your own topology.

## Customization ideas

- Rename `is-a` to `type-of` and switch its edge color to a brighter blue for clearer taxonomy graphs.
- Set the node shape to `hexagon` or `star` when showcasing groups or categories.
- Try `image` or `circularImage` shapes to preview the placeholder node artwork and see how image nodes feel.

## Relationship label inspiration

- `parent-of` → `depends-on`
- `manages` → `owns`
- `works-with` → `collaborates-with`
